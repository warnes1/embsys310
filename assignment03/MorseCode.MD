Problem 3


a) Whats is Morse Code?

	For this answer we will let '1 Unit' represent 250ms of time.
Morse code is a means of sending electronic/visible communications by encoding letters as a fixed 
sequence of DOT(S) and/or DASH(ES) unique to each letter. A DOT is represented with an ON/HIGH state of
1 Unit, a DASH is represented with an ON/HIGH state of 3 Units. A SPACE between the DOTS/DASHES
is representing as delay of 1 Unit. A SPACE between letters is represented as a delay of 3 Units.
A SPACE between words is represented as a delay of 7 Units. Letters are not represented by the same
numbers of DOTS/DASHS. Letters that occur more frequently in the English language are assigned
shorter sequences, for instance 'E' is the most commonly used letter in the English language and is
represented by an encoding of a single DOT, whereas a letter like 'Y' which is infrequently used
is represented as DASH-DOT-DASH-DASH. This variable length encoding, based on letter frequency in the
language, facilitates increased transmission rates.

	



b) Who developed Morse Code?

	The originator of the 1st version of Morse Code was the American Artist & Inventor
Samuel F.B. Morse in the 1830s for electrical telegraphy. This version was further refined
by Alfred Lewis Vail. A Second version arose in Europe after it became apparent that the 1st
version was not adequate for non-English text, and was devise by a conference of European
nations in 1851.
